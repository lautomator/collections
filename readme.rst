Collections
===========

Here are a few Django-powered apps that track inventory and keep notes.
They are:

* Publications: books
* Reader: blog
* About (a static page)

Setup
=====
To get this going:
- Install Postgres and create a database locally
- Adjust Django settings, accordingly
- Install virtualenv and install the requirements:

``
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

``
- Run the Django server

``
python jm_collections/manage.py runserver
``

If all goes well you can create a user account to work with locally. If not, check the database configuration, including the connection and dev passwords. Be sure all of the virtualenv requirements are set.

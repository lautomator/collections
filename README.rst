Django Projects

These files are used for the continuation of my django learning. 
Here are a few apps that track inventory and notes from a database.
They are:

* Publications: books
* Reader: blog
* About (a static page)

Additionally, there is a login that allows a user to update, add, and delete contents from both Publications and Reader.
